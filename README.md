# R_Analysis
Statistical analysis of two datasets:
- An mpg testing dataset of 50 potential prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance were collected for each vehicle.
- MechaCar suspension coil test results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacity of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across lots.
- The analysis of the dataset is included on the file MechaCarWriteUp.txt and the R code is in the file MechaCarChallenge.
